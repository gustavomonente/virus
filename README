Ten-Young Guh

Not tested on bingsuns, which is SunOS; this virus is for Linux, not POSIX

On a recent Linux, run `make` to compile,
then run `virus` in the working directory whose files you would like to infect.

Behavior
========
The virus attempts to infect every likely-uninfected executable ELF file
it finds in the working directory, and reports to standard error any files it cannot infect.

Running an infected file shall behave as above,
then execute the victim with the same arguments and environment.

Notes
=====
A victim first attempts to infect every file in the working directory,
copies the rest of itself after the virus to a temporary file,
and executes the temporary file.

First, the virus attempts to resize the victim,
then infect the victim in-place.
If the virus cannot open the victim with read-write permissions,
then it attempts to create a temporary file,
infect a copy of the victim into the temporary file,
then replace the victim with the temporary file.

The virus only infects a file if, upon reading the file,
    * the file contains the ELF signature;
    * the file, according to the ELF format, is of executable type; and
    * at the offset in the virus of the virus's identifier, the file also contains the identifier.

Since the virus executes an unecrypted victim,
it is easy to disinfect a victim by tracing when it calls execve.
The path it passes to execve locates the temporary file.
Even if a file no longer exists on any filesystem, Linux only deletes it
if neither any filesystem nor any process refers to it.
Thanks to Linux's proc system, you can still recover the file
at /proc/[pid]/fds/[fd].

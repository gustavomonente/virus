Ten-Young Guh

Not tested on bingsuns, which is SunOS; this virus is for Linux, not POSIX

On a recent Linux, run `make` to compile,
then run `virus` in the working directory whose files you would like to infect.

The virus attempts to infect every file (after symlink-following)
it finds in the working directory, and reports to standard error any files it cannot infect.
The virus does not care about a file's executability, as that may change over time anyway.
Of course, it will always fail to infect directories "." and "..",
so seeing the virus fail to infect them helps visualize the virus in action.

Running an infected file shall behave as above,
then execute the victim with the same arguments and environment.

Nothing stops the virus from re-infecting the same file;
re-infection can quickly balloon the file size and bog down its startup time
(time before bottommost victim execution).
